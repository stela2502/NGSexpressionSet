# Usage

At the moment this is no working R package as I have not set up all help files and am most likely missing a ton of other things too.

But I can use the R libs anyhow by sourceing in all R/*.R files and the load_libs.R file.

At the moment this can be seen as a private, horribly documented piece of work.
