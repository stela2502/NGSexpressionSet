\usage{
check(x, genes = NULL, cutoff = 0.77)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the NGSexpressionSet}

\item{genes}{see reads.taken}

\item{cutoff}{= 0.77 a good expression dataset should not use more than 77% of the reads in the top 5%

this function calls reads.taken.NGSexpressionSet internally.}

a list of samples which have passed the test
